on the array you have:
1. words (will be DIV or SPAN) on the other
2. images (will be DIV) on one side and
3. set order place of the image

5. SPAN or DIV - class (to the image)
6. SPAN or DIV - class (to the word)

*** If you are more comfortable working with several arrays we have no problem
let activities = [
['lion', 'lion.png ',1,4, 'classAtoimage', 'classBtoword ', '#445566' ],
['tomato', 'tomato.png ',2,1, 'classAtoimage', 'classCtoword ' , '#445566'],
['car', 'car.png ',3,5, 'classAtoimage', 'classDtoword ','0' ],
['ice cream', 'ice_cream.png ',4,2, 'classAtoimage', 'classEtoword ','0' ],
['chicken', 'chicken.png ',5,3, 'classAtoimage', 'classEtoword ', '#445566'' ]
